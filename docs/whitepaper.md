# DeedChain: On-Chain Land Registry and Tokenization

## Abstract
DeedChain digitizes land ownership as verifiable NFTs with DAO-verified registration and enables fractional tokenization for liquidity and inclusive investment.

## Problem
Land records are opaque, corruptible, and inefficient, leading to fraud and economic exclusion.

## Solution
- NFT Deeds (ERC-721) for immutable ownership
- DAO validator layer for verification
- Smart-contract transfers requiring multi-party approval
- Fractionalization via ERC-20 tokens (LandShares)

## Architecture
- Linea zkEVM smart contracts
- IPFS for metadata/documents
- Backend APIs for indexing and integrations
- Frontend dApp for citizens, validators, and investors

## Tokenomics (Summary)
- $LAND for payments, staking, governance, and rewards

## Roadmap
- MVP: Registry + Verification
- Phase 2: Tokenization + Marketplace
- Phase 3: Integrations (banks/gov), analytics
