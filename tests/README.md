# Tests

This folder holds cross-repo test plans and high-level integration scenarios.

- Smart contracts: see `blockchain/test/`
- Backend API: add integration tests under `server/tests/`
- Client E2E: consider Playwright/Cypress under `client/e2e/`

Suggested scenarios:
- Register → Verify → Transfer lifecycle
- Fractionalization issuance and redemption
- Permissions for validator-only actions
